        <p>
        I hate cooking.<br>
        Sadly a lot of people are, same as me, in the difficult position of having to cook for themselves. And to eat out, or order food is expensive and not everybody able to afford.
        So, if you haven’t managed to catch a partner (or optional flatmate) with interest in cooking: Here is the cookbook that really helps you through your life.</p>
        <p>
        On this page you can find the one and only collection of recipes for when you really, really don’t want to cook but have to admit to yourself that a bag of potato crisps just doesn’t qualify as a balanced meal.
        (But in a pinch it’ll still do. And don’t feel guilty, life is hard and sometimes it needs bags of potato crisps to deal with.)
